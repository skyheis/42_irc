The recv() and send() functions in C/C++ are used for sending and receiving
data over a socket connection. They are commonly used in network programming
to transfer information between a client and a server.


The recv() function is used to receive data from a connected socket.
It has the following function prototype:

	ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);

The parameters of recv() are as follows:

    sockfd:	The socket file descriptor of the connected socket.
    buf:	A pointer to the buffer where the received data will be stored.
    len:	The maximum number of bytes to receive.
    flags:	Flags that modify the behavior of the recv() function
			(such as setting it to non-blocking mode).

The recv() function returns the number of bytes received,or -1 if an error occurs.
A return value of 0 indicates that the connection has been closed by the remote side.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of recv():

cpp

		char buffer[1024];
		ssize_t bytesRead = recv(socketDescriptor, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
		if (bytesRead == -1) {
			// Error handling
		} else if (bytesRead == 0) {
			// Connection closed by the remote side
		} else {
			// Process the received data
		}

In this example, socketDescriptor is the file descriptor of the connected socket.
The received data is stored in the buffer, and bytesRead contains the number of bytes received.



The send() function is used to send data over a connected socket.
It has the following function prototype:

		ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags);

The parameters of send() are as follows:

    sockfd: The socket file descriptor of the connected socket.
    buf: A pointer to the data to be sent.
    len: The number of bytes to send.
    flags: Flags that modify the behavior of the send() function
	(such as setting it to non-blocking mode).

The send() function returns the number of bytes sent, or -1 if an error occurs.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of send():

		const char *message = "Hello, server!";
		ssize_t bytesSent = send(socketDescriptor, message, strlen(message), 0);
		if (bytesSent == -1) {
			// Error handling
		} else {
			// Sent successfully
		}

In this example, socketDescriptor is the file descriptor of the connected socket.
The message is the data to be sent, and strlen(message) provides the length of the message in bytes.

Both recv() and send() functions can be used in combination to establish bidirectional
communication between a client and a server. It's important to handle errors appropriately
and ensure that the correct amount of data is sent and received to ensure reliable communication.
