The struct epoll_event is a structure used in the epoll I/O event notification mechanism
in Linux. It represents an event that can be monitored by the epoll API.
Here's an explanation of the members of the struct epoll_event:

		struct epoll_event {
			uint32_t events;  // The events to monitor
			epoll_data_t data;  // Data associated with the event
		};

The struct epoll_event has two members:

    events:	This member specifies the events of interest that you want to monitor.
			It is an unsigned 32-bit integer of type uint32_t.
			You can set multiple event flags by bitwise OR'ing them together.
			The commonly used event flags are:
				EPOLLIN:	Indicates that there is data available to read.
				EPOLLOUT:	Indicates that the file descriptor is ready for writing.
				EPOLLERR:	Indicates that an error has occurred on the file descriptor.
				EPOLLRDHUP:	Indicates that the remote end of the socket has been closed or shutdown.

   		There are other event flags available as well, which you can refer to in the epoll documentation.

    data:	This member is of type epoll_data_t and holds the data associated with the event.
			It is a union that can be used to associate either a file descriptor (int) or
			a pointer (void*) with the event. It allows you to associate additional data with
			the event to identify the corresponding file descriptor or any other context-specific information.

   		The epoll_data_t union looks like this:

			typedef union epoll_data {
				void* ptr;
				int fd;
				uint32_t u32;
				uint64_t u64;
			} epoll_data_t;

You can use the appropriate member of the data union depending on your needs.
For example, if you want to associate a file descriptor with the event, you can set the fd member of the data union.

Example usage:

		struct epoll_event event{};
		event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT;
		event.data.fd = fileDescriptor;

In this example, the events member is set to monitor both read and write events, and
the data.fd member is set to associate the fileDescriptor with the event.

The struct epoll_event allows you to specify the events you want to monitor and associate
relevant data with each event. It provides flexibility in monitoring multiple events
simultaneously and associating additional information with the events.

When using epoll_wait(), the received events will be populated into an array of struct epoll_event
structures, and you can examine the events member of each structure to determine the type of event
that occurred and take appropriate action based on it.
