The epoll_create1() function is used to create an epoll instance, which is the main object
that allows monitoring and handling of I/O events using the epoll mechanism in Linux.
It returns a file descriptor associated with the epoll instance.

The function prototype of epoll_create1() is as follows:

		int epoll_create1(int flags);

The parameter flags is an integer that allows specifying additional options for the epoll instance.
Currently, the only supported value is 0, which creates a regular epoll instance.

The return value of epoll_create1() is the file descriptor associated with the created epoll instance.
If an error occurs, it returns -1, and you can check the value of errno to determine the specific error condition.

Here's an example of using epoll_create1() to create an epoll instance:

		#include <sys/epoll.h>
		#include <iostream>

		int epollfd = epoll_create1(0);
		if (epollfd == -1) {
			std::cerr << "Failed to create epoll instance." << std::endl;
			return -1;
		}

In this example, epoll_create1(0) is called to create an epoll instance. If the function call
succeeds, the file descriptor associated with the epoll instance is stored in the variable epollfd.
If the function call fails, it indicates an error, and you can handle it accordingly.

Once you have created the epoll instance using epoll_create1(), you can add file descriptors
to it using epoll_ctl() with the EPOLL_CTL_ADD command and monitor events on those file descriptors using epoll_wait().

Remember to handle errors appropriately and check the return values of the functions
to ensure successful creation and usage of the epoll instance.
