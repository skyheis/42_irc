he bind() function in C/C++ is used to associate a socket with a specific
address (IP address and port number) on the local machine. It is typically used by servers
to specify the address on which they want to listen for incoming connections.

The function prototype of bind() is as follows:

		int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);

The bind() function takes three parameters:

    sockfd:	This parameter is the socket file descriptor, obtained from
			the socket() function, that you want to bind to a specific address.

    addr:	This parameter is a pointer to a sockaddr structure that contains
			the address information to bind the socket to. The actual type of
			the structure passed depends on the address family specified when creating the socket.
			For IPv4 addresses, you use the sockaddr_in structure and cast it to sockaddr* for the addr parameter.

    addrlen: This parameter specifies the length of the address structure pointed to by addr.
			For IPv4 addresses, it is typically set to sizeof(struct sockaddr_in).

The bind() function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure. In case of an error, you can check
the value of errno to determine the specific error that occurred.

Here's an example usage of the bind() function to bind a socket to a specific IP address and port number:

		#include <arpa/inet.h>

		int serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
		// ... error handling omitted

		sockaddr_in serverAddress{};
		serverAddress.sin_family = AF_INET;
		serverAddress.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // Bind to any available IP address
		serverAddress.sin_port = htons(portNumber); // Set the port number

		if (bind(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress)) == -1) {
			// Error handling
		}

In this example, serverSocket is the socket file descriptor obtained from the socket() function.
portNumber represents the desired port number, and serverAddress is a sockaddr_in structure that contains the address information.

By calling bind() with the appropriate socket and address parameters, you associate the socket
with the specified address. After a successful bind(), the socket is ready to listen for incoming connections
or perform other communication tasks associated with that address.
