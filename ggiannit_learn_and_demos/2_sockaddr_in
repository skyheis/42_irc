The sockaddr_in structure is used in C/C++ socket programming to represent an internet address for the IPv4 protocol.
It contains the necessary information to establish a connection or bind a socket to a specific IP address and port number.

Here's the definition of the sockaddr_in structure from the netinet/in.h header file:
		struct sockaddr_in {
			short int sin_family; // Address family (AF_INET)
			unsigned short int sin_port; // Port number
			struct in_addr sin_addr; // Internet address
			unsigned char sin_zero[8]; // Padding for structure size compatibility
		};

Let's go through the members of the sockaddr_in structure:

    sin_family:	This member specifies the address family and is set
				to AF_INET, indicating IPv4 addresses.

    sin_port:	This member holds the port number in network byte order (big-endian).
				You can use the htons() function to convert the port number from host
				byte order to network byte order.

    sin_addr:	This member represents the IP address. It is of type struct in_addr
				and contains the IP address in network byte order. To set the IP address,
				you can use the inet_pton() function to convert a string
				representation of the IP address to the required format.

    sin_zero:	This member is used for padding to ensure that the sockaddr_in structure
				has the same size as the older sockaddr structure.
				It is generally not used and is typically set to all zeros.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to set up the sockaddr_in structure with an IP address and port number:


		#include <arpa/inet.h>

		sockaddr_in serverAddress{};
		serverAddress.sin_family = AF_INET;
		serverAddress.sin_port = htons(portNumber); // Set the port number
		inet_pton(AF_INET, ipAddress, &(serverAddress.sin_addr)); // Set the IP address

In this example, portNumber represents the desired port number, and ipAddress is a string
containing the IP address in the dotted-decimal notation. The inet_pton() function converts the IP address string
to network byte order and assigns it to the sin_addr member of the sockaddr_in structure.

The sockaddr_in structure is commonly used when working with sockets in C/C++ to specify the network
address and port for communication.
